Today's entry in our cosmic logbook took us to where our dreams of reaching the stars are literally ignited! The Stennis Space Center in Mississippi is renowned as the heart of rocket engine testing. _Technically,_ we visited the [Infinity Science Center](https://visitinfinity.com), host to the Stennis Nasa Visitor Center, offering an immersive and educational expereience from carnivorous plants to the out of this world space gallery. 

_Tours of the [Stennis Space Center](https://youtu.be/tP7bNZt0QBU?si=hBjEdHuZ4c5f8zdy) are only available virtually._

At the science center, the story of Stennis and its pivotal role in space exploration, unfolds in a fascinating and accessible way. We were particularly captivated by the history of rocket testing at Stennis, enrapturing us with a captivating tale woven with trials, triumphs, and innovation.. Overall, it was a neat little visitor center, complete with an Apollo 4 Capsule and an Apollo 19 Saturn V First Stage Rocket. My favorite exhibit had to be the lego space shuttle.

But it was more than just rocket engines. It celebrates curiosity and exploration of all types. We delved into exhibits about Earth's intricate ecosystems and the potential of deep-sea exploration. I, even, enjoyed many of the hands-on science, ostensibly available for children. 

This layover reminded us that exploration isn't just about what's out there in the stars, but also about understanding our own planet.

Stennis showed us that the journey to space is really about humanity's indomitable will to explore.

As we close today’s chapter in our cosmic logbook, we’re reminded of the boundless realms of human endeavor - from the depths of our oceans to the far reaches of space. At places like Stennis, the flame of this endeavor burns bright, propelling us ever onward to the stars.

Until our next celestial update, let the spirit of discovery keep your minds alight and your hearts soaring to infinity and beyond!
