# {{page.title}}

When it became apparent that we would lose my beloved Anisa, my partner suggested a {{page.description}}, where could spend time with each other, enjoy places that may have been limited to us before, and just recover together. Through many tears, I tried to think about the joy we would experience and wanted to make plans while Anisa was still with me, so that I could feel like she was part of this journey. Unfortunately, that was too much for me and I was only able to create an overarching idea of places we might vaguely be interested in experiencing. Leaving all the details and minutiae until after her death. 

This is a document of our journey through time and space. I'm sure you will feel my heartfelt emotions as I attempt to traverse the worlds sans Anisa. At the very least, this will be a place to reflect and to share this journey with others. I hope you stay for the beautiful memories we will be building along the way.
