When it became apparent that we would lose our beloved Anisa, my partner suggested a _{{page.description}}_, where we could spend some much needed time with each other, enjoy places that may have been limited to us before, and just recover together. 

Through many tears, I tried to think about the joy we would experience and wanted to make plans while Anisa was still with me, because I wanted to feel like she was part of this journey. Unfortunately, that was too much for me and I was only able to capture the idea of places we might vaguely want to experience. Leaving all the details and minutiae until after her death. 

<p style="text-align:center;"> Put simply, the idea was space. </p>

This will document our journey through time and space. 

I will share my heartfelt emotions as I attempt to traverse the world sans Anisa. At the very least, this will be a place to reflect and share this journey with our friends. 

I hope you stay for the beautiful memories we will be building along the way.
