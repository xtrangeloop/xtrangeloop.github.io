When it became apparent that we would lose our beloved Anisa, my partner suggested a _{{page.description}}_, where we could spend some much needed time with each other, enjoy places that may have been limited to us before, and just recover together. 

Through many tears, I tried to think about the joy we would experience and wanted to make plans while Anisa was still with me, because I wanted to feel like she was part of this journey. That was, unfortunately, too much for me and I was only able to create the idea of places we might vaguely want to experience. Leaving all the details and minutiae until after her death. 

This is a document of our journey through time and space. 

I will share my heartfelt emotions as I attempt to traverse the worlds sans Anisa. At the very least, this will be a place to reflect and to share this journey with others. 

I hope you stay for the beautiful memories we will be building along the way.
