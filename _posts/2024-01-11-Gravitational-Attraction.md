For us, Orlando acted as a gravitational attraction point, a sun, pulling our friends into orbit. Friends from work, friends from school, friends from trips... friends we'd met in England, in Korea, and, even, in Florida. 
 
There's something magical about connecting with dear friends, sharing stories and laughter that echoes with familiarity and warmth. Though sweet, one day with each was much too short. Luckily we were able to share our love of art and history as we enjoyed the Kennedy Space Center, a fancy hotel with its art and sculpture garden, and a fantastic gem of an eclectic museum.

The Kennedy Space Center enabled us to explore the vast expanse of space. It was as if we were walking among the stars, following the breadcrumbs of astronauts who dared to dream beyond our world, and watching history come alive as were fortunate enough to witness two space launches. Okay, so I might have slept through the Peregrine, but in my defense it launched at 0218!

Next we dove into the vibrant art scene through an array of art and sculpture museums. Each gallery was filled with creative expressions that challenged and inspired from contemporary pieces that pushed the boundaries of imagination to classic sculptures that spoke of timeless beauty. We learned about [Albin Polasek](https://polasek.org) and his work. The [Orlanda Museum of Art](https://omart.org) had a wonder collection of photography. In contrast, [Snap!](https://www.snaporlando.com) disappointingly had no photography. 

My absolute favorite find was our happenstance visit to the ecclectic museum. It had many small pieces all smashed together in a beautiful and slightly whimisical way. The classic cars were wonderfully maintained and even had a [jukebox display](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sPwhQjx483s). There was a small but glorious King Tutankhamun exhibit. An old general store. A collection of classic, and I mean classic, toys. The whole museum was a testament to the creativity that thrives on our planet.

As we wandered through these artistic spaces, many of them with our friends, we found ourselves reflecting on the beauty of human expression. Art is a journey into the unknown; a pursuit of something beyond the ordinary. It was a profound reminder that our world is a canvas of endless possibilities. 

Our time in Orlando was a beautiful fusion of friendship, science, and art. It reinforced the idea that our journey is not just about the places we visit, but the experiences we share and the perspectives we gain.

The scientific term for pulling things towards a point in space is "gravitational attraction" or simply "gravity." This fundamental force of nature is what causes objects with mass to be attracted to each other. In the context of space, it's the force that keeps planets in orbit around stars, moons in orbit around planets, and governs the motion of galaxies and other celestial bodies.


Dear fellow travelers on this cosmic journey, our latest orbit brought us to the vibrant and diverse landscape of Orlando, Florida. Here, we found a delightful blend of friendship, space exploration, and artistic wonder, each moment painting a vivid stroke on our road trip canvas.

Our time in Orlando began with a heartwarming reunion with friends. There's something magical about connecting with dear ones under the Floridian sun, sharing stories and laughter that echo with familiarity and warmth. These moments were a reminder of the precious bonds that keep us grounded, even as we explore the vastness of our universe.

Next, we set course for the Kennedy Space Center, a place where the wonders of space exploration come to life. Standing beneath the immense rockets, we were awestruck by humanity's leap into the cosmos. Each exhibit was a portal into the vast expanse of space, igniting a sense of awe and curiosity. It was as if we were walking among the stars, following the trails of astronauts who dared to dream beyond our world.

But Orlando's allure didn't end with the stars. We dove into the city's vibrant art scene, exploring an array of art and sculpture museums. Each gallery was a universe in itself, filled with creative expressions that challenged and inspired. From contemporary pieces that pushed the boundaries of imagination to classic sculptures that spoke of timeless beauty, Orlando's art world was a testament to the creativity that thrives on our planet.

As we wandered through these artistic spaces, we found ourselves reflecting on the beauty of human expression. Art, like space travel, is a journey into the unknown, a pursuit of something beyond the ordinary. It was a profound reminder that our world, much like the universe, is a canvas of endless possibilities.

Our time in Orlando was a beautiful fusion of friendship, science, and art. It reinforced the idea that our journey is not just about the places we visit, but the experiences we share and the new perspectives we gain.

As we bid farewell to Orlando, we carry with us memories etched in the heart and a renewed sense of wonder. We're excited to see what other marvels await us on this incredible road trip. So, stay tuned as we continue to navigate through this magnificent tapestry of adventures!

Until our next update, may your path be filled with friendship, discovery, and beauty.
