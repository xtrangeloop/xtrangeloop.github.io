Our cosmic journey came to an icy halt as we hibernated for an extra week in Huntsville, Alabama, which proudly embraces the moniker Rocket City for its pivotal role in propelling humans into space. Yet, in a delightful twist of fate, we found ourselves grounded; navigating a rather unexpected southern terrestrial phenomenon: snow and ice!

think about a cool space related title to capture my time in Huntsville, al. It snowed while we were here. The first week we were basically snowed in, well iced in. Luckily, on day 1 or 2 we realized we were in for a freeze and snuck out while the snow was still fresh to grab some food from the local grocery store. We extended a week here because the whole city was shut down. They didn't have any ice clearing equipment. So, we waited for the one digit temperatures to climb and the rain to drench the ice before venturing out again. 

We In this city, where rockets soar and dreams take flight, we experienced a rare winter spectacle. Just as we were settling into the rhythm of Huntsville's space-infused aura, the skies decided to blanket the city in a shimmering layer of snow, turning it into a winter wonderland. However, this beauty came with a twist – the city was iced in, and so were we!

On day one, as the first flurries began to dance from the sky, we sensed an imminent change. With a quick dash to the local grocery store, we stocked up on essentials, preparing for what would become a week of hibernation. As the temperatures plunged to single digits, Huntsville transformed before our eyes, the ice encapsulating everything in a silent, frosty embrace.

This unexpected pause in our journey turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Hunkered down, we found ourselves reflecting on the beauty and power of nature – a force that, much like space, is vast, awe-inspiring, and at times, wonderfully unpredictable. We spent our days watching the winter scene unfold outside our window, reading, sharing stories, and planning future adventures.

As the city, unaccustomed to such wintry spells, waited for the ice to melt, we too waited, finding joy in the stillness. There's something profoundly peaceful about being snowed in, especially when you're in a city that's usually all about launching into the great beyond.

After a week, as the ice began to relent under the gentle persuasion of rain and rising temperatures, we ventured out again. The Rocket City, still dusted with remnants of snow, welcomed us back into its fold. Our exploration of Huntsville, delayed but not deterred, began anew – this time with the fresh perspective that only an unexpected winter hibernation can bring.

So, as we continue our journey through the Strange Loops of our world, let's not forget the beauty of the unexpected detours. Sometimes, it's in these frozen moments that we find warmth, reflection, and a renewed sense of wonder.

Until the next update, keep your eyes to the skies and your hearts open to the surprises along the way!
