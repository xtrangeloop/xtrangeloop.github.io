Our cosmic journey came to an icy halt as we hibernated for an extra week in Huntsville, Alabama —— which proudly embraces its moniker of Rocket City for its pivotal role in propelling humans into space. 

Yet, in a delightful twist of fate, we found ourselves grounded; navigating a rather unexpected southern terrestrial phenomenon: snow and ice!

We made it safely from Stennis to Huntsville before the ominously named Polar Vortex lambasted the city. However, by day two we already sensed that we were in for a long shut in. With a not-so-quick dash to the local grocery, we stocked up on hotel-friendly essentials in prepartion for what would become almost a week of hibernation. As the temperatures plunged to single digits, ice encapsulated Huntsville in a silent, frosty embrace.

It was eerily beautiful and quite unexpected; this unanticipated pause in our journey. It allowed us time to reflect on the beauty and power of nature – a force that, much like space, is vast, awe-inspiring, and at times, wonderfully unpredictable. We spent our days watching the winter scene unfold outside our window, while listening to audiobooks and working on our myriad projects.

As Rocket City, unaccustomed to such wintry spells, simply waited for the ice to melt; we, too, waited. Finding joy in the stillness. 

Soon, the ice began to relent under the gentle persuasion of rain, rising temperatures, and, finally, a road grader, and we once again ventured forth into the wintery wonderland. Our exploration of Rocket City, delayed but not deterred, began anew – this time with the fresh perspective that only stillness can bring.

We first ventured into a whimsically transformed downtown with its ice-glazed streets to tour the musuem of art. Sadly, the musuem was closed, but we were soon rewarded in this frosty landscape as we quite literally followed our noses to [Condado Tacos](https://locations.condadotacos.com/al/401-williams-ave-sw). The warm, inviting smell of meat grilling led us just behind the musuem, where this unexpected taco joint was nestled at the base of a business building. Once inside, we were instantly transported to a haven for fantasy and adventure. The walls were a tapestry of mythical creatures and epic quests from Dungeons & Dragons. The women's restroom amusingly had an _Eye of the Beholder_! 

Sitting there, amidst the D&D décor, munching on savory nachos, we couldn't help but marvel at the unexpected intersections of our journey. Here we were, in a city known for its monumental contributions to space exploration, finding solace and warmth in a corner of fantasy and imagination. It was a reminder that exploration comes in many forms – from the vast reaches of space to the boundless realms of the mind.

This quirky, charming spot stayed in our hearts, as a small yet vibrant beacon of life and imagination amidst the icy quiet all around. This bright spot in our winter odyssey, reminded us that even in the depths of a frozen orbit, pockets of warmth and joy can be found in the most unexpected places.

As we continue our journey through the Strange Loops of our world, let's not forget the beauty of the unexpected detours. Sometimes, it's in these frozen moments that we find warmth, reflection, and a renewed sense of wonder.

Until our next starry update, may your journeys be filled with as many delightful surprises as ours. Keep exploring, in all realms the universe has to offer!

think about a cool space related title to capture my time in Huntsville, al. It snowed while we were here. The first week we were basically snowed in, well iced in. Luckily, on day 1 or 2 we realized we were in for a freeze and snuck out while the snow was still fresh to grab some food from the local grocery store. We extended a week here because the whole city was shut down. They didn't have any ice clearing equipment. So, we waited for the one digit temperatures to climb and the rain to drench the ice before venturing out again. 

We In this city, where rockets soar and dreams take flight, we experienced a rare winter spectacle. Just as we were settling into the rhythm of Huntsville's space-infused aura, the skies decided to blanket the city in a shimmering layer of snow, turning it into a winter wonderland. However, this beauty came with a twist – the city was iced in, and so were we!

On day one, as the first flurries began to dance from the sky, we sensed an imminent change. With a quick dash to the local grocery store, we stocked up on essentials, preparing for what would become a week of hibernation. As the temperatures plunged to single digits, Huntsville transformed before our eyes, the ice encapsulating everything in a silent, frosty embrace.

This unexpected pause in our journey turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Hunkered down, we found ourselves reflecting on the beauty and power of nature – a force that, much like space, is vast, awe-inspiring, and at times, wonderfully unpredictable. We spent our days watching the winter scene unfold outside our window, reading, sharing stories, and planning future adventures.

As the city, unaccustomed to such wintry spells, waited for the ice to melt, we too waited, finding joy in the stillness. There's something profoundly peaceful about being snowed in, especially when you're in a city that's usually all about launching into the great beyond.

After a week, as the ice began to relent under the gentle persuasion of rain and rising temperatures, we ventured out again. The Rocket City, still dusted with remnants of snow, welcomed us back into its fold. Our exploration of Huntsville, delayed but not deterred, began anew – this time with the fresh perspective that only an unexpected winter hibernation can bring.

So, as we continue our journey through the Strange Loops of our world, let's not forget the beauty of the unexpected detours. Sometimes, it's in these frozen moments that we find warmth, reflection, and a renewed sense of wonder.

Until the next update, keep your eyes to the skies and your hearts open to the surprises along the way!
