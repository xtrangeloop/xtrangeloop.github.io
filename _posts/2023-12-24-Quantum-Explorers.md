<h2 class="w3-text-teal">Welcome to Lovecraft's Venus</h2>

"In the Walls of Eryx" inspired this quantum-esque game. Written by H.P. Lovecraft and Kenneth Sterling, this story represents one of Lovecraft's only forays into science fiction. It, of course, retains elements of cosmic horror as the protagonist willingly enters an invisible maze while harvesting crystals on Venus. While he quickly finds his way to the large crystal at the center, he may never find a way out. 

<h1 class="w3-text-red">Escape the Venusian Labyrinth!</h1>

Just as you touch the largest crystal you've ever seen, the world seems to shift around you, evoking a sense of disorientation, unknown danger, and cosmic dread. The lush jungle of the Venusian environment suddenly seems alien and hostile as a thick, misty atmosphere settles over the strange flora. You shake off the feeling of dread and turn to go the way you came, only to find your path blocked. 

The Venusian landscape is vibrant with dense vegetation. The poisonous atmosphere is heavy with a sense of isolation and impending doom. You are ill-preparred; your oxygen and water are limited. The only other items in your pack are an energy bar, an iPad with stylus, and a futuristic device that allows you to play messages and recordings. _This comes in handy as you almost immediately uncover logs from previous explorers who failed to escape._ 

You must navigate the invisible maze by making decisions at various points. Be careful though! Your choices affect not only your current position but also the state of other parts of the maze, representing quantum entanglement. You must draw upon all your understanding of quantum mechanics to predict the outcomes of your choices and escape the maze. _Managing resources effectively while facing environmental hazards adds an extra layer of difficulty._

#### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Players must navigate the invisible maze using their knowledge of quantum mechanics. They can use entaglement to teleprot to other parts of the maze.
- **Visibility Mechanics**: The paths of the maze occasionally become visible for brief moments, either through environmental changes or player actions, providing clues for navigation.
- **Resource Management**: Players have limited resources, emphasizing careful planning and the need for strategy to survive.
