<h1>Welcome to my {{ site.description }}.</h1>

A virtual [salon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_%28gathering%29#Salons_outside_of_France), in the traditional sense.

I find that regardless of our differences, unexplainable loops intricately spiral through our world, winding along, connecting us. At times you arrive where you already were, you struggle against the loop, all the while attempting to explain the inexplicable, the inter-connectedness, the coincidences. This is the adventure, the journey that we share, that fascinates me. 
     
This journey is characterized by the developments of humanity, from the first inkling of philosophy through historical, visual, biologic, linguistic, religious and cultural perspectives; culminating in the diverse world in which we live. I'm interested in a vast array of subjects, from philosophy, raja yoga, photography, and the "Self" to IT Security, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing. 

I will share my thoughts and opinions spanning vast subjects and experiences. I hope to build a generally fashionable community for literary, artistic, and political people that fosters creativity and growth, both on an individual and a cultural level.
